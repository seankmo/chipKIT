        <span class="TB-BODY"><p class="MsoNormal">This project will demonstrate how
        to use buttons to turn on and off light
        emitting diodes (LEDs). You are probably already familiar with
        traditional light switches that directly control whether or not
        electrical energy is delivered to a light bulb. In this project, three
        buttons are used to control three LEDs, but the buttons
        are <i>not</i> directly connected to the LEDs. Instead,
        the buttons
        are used to establish voltages that are "read" via the chipKIT digital
        input/output (I/O) pins. From these voltages, we can determine if a
        button is pressed or not (i.e., we can determine a button's
        "state"). Each LED is then illuminated in accordance with the state
        of the corresponding button.

        Place the three LEDs in the breadboard as shown in Figure 2, keeping
        track of which of the two "legs" is the anode and which is the cathode
        (the anode is the longer leg).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        Using three wires, connect the anode
        of one LED to pin 8, the anode of another to pin 11, and another to pin
        12.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
         Now connect the chipKIT GND pin (there may be multiple GND pins,
         so just use the one closest to the 5V pin) to a bus strip at the bottom of the breadboard.   
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From the perspective of Figure 2, the bus strips are the horizontal rows on a breadboard that are all electrically connected.
                    They are usually separated from the main section of the board and are sometimes marked in red and blue. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bus strips are normally used to connect voltage supplies and grounds to the breadboard, because they provide easy access from other points on the breadboard.       
                </li>    
                <li>
                    For the rest of this project, the bus strips connect to the GND pin will be referred to as the ground bus strip.
                </li>

        </li>
        <li>
        Now, attach one 330-ohm resistor to the cathode of
        each of the LEDs. The other ends of these resistors should all be placed so that they connect to the ground bus strip. This can be done by placing the lead directly into the bus strip,
        or by using a small wire to connect from a column in the main section of the breadboard to the ground bus strip (as in Figure 2).&nbsp;</li>

        When there is a single path for charge to flow
        through two components,
        (when any charge that flows through one component must also flow
        through the other) then we say the components are <a href="P04_KVL_KCL.html#SER"><i>in series</i></a>.
        Each of the three LEDs in this circuit has a resistor in series with
        it. Series resistors
        are used to limit the current that passes through
        their particular branches of the circuit. LEDs are non-linear devices
        and can potentially pass large amounts of current when they exceed
        their threshold voltage by small amounts. The series resistor keeps
        the current at a safe level.&nbsp; This helps to protect the LEDs
        and
        chipKIT board from the potential damage of drawing too much
        current.<br>
        Connecting
        external LEDs and series resistors are discussed more in
        depth in <font color="#0000ff">Project 3: Blink External LED.</font>

    pairs with the top two terminals of the devices being

    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>Another way of thinking about
    this is to examine the circuit
    diagrams of Figs. 7a and 7b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
    7a,
    it is easy to see that when the button is not pressed, the loop formed
    going clockwise from the
    voltage source through the resistor is not connected. Thus, it is an
    incomplete
    circuit (no current is flowing through the loop). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Since
    the open occurs before the point we are
    measuring, there is no voltage difference between that point and
    ground, and
    it should measure 0 v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In Figure 7b, you can see that
    the loop is now completed when the button ins pressed. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In
    this
    simple circuit the resistor and voltage sources are the only components
    in the
    circuit. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>For simplicity's sake,
    we consider the button to be an ideal component and there for offers no
    opposition to current flow when it is pressed.  The concept of “ideal” is used
    during circuit analysis to denote that a component works exactly like its circuit model predicts.
    Using a button example to illustrate this, the circuit model of a button is what one might expect,
    a device that when pressed completes a circuit, and then while pressed acts much like a wire.
    In reality nothing can act perfectly, components may have slight variances from there “ideal” model,
    although these variances are often incredibly small.  A button for instance offers a very small amount
    of resistance to the flow of current (and in fact even wires themselves do as well),
    but it such a negligible amount that often enough it can be ignored to simplify the circuit for analysis purposes.
    (As we have done in this case.)   </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="P04_KVL_KCL.html#KVL">Kirchhoff&#8217;s
    voltage law
    (KVL)</a> states that the sum of all voltages
    (both supplied voltages and voltage drops) around a closed loop in a circuit must be
    equal to
    zero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A voltage
    drop is defined as the
    voltage difference before and after a single component. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>So for Figure 7b, if the
    voltage source supplies
    5V, the voltage drop across the resistor must also equal 5V.</p>

        <li>Connect the chipKIT 5V pin to a bus strip close to the ground bus strip (this was set up in step 1).
        Note that in Figure 10 the LEDs are not shown for simplicity. 
        </li>
        <li> Place buttons A , B, and C, onto the
        breadboard as seen in Figure 10.&nbsp; Most breadboards have uniform gaps between
        columns in the main secton of the board (with the board placed as in Figure 10).&nbsp; The
        buttons used in this project are large enough to span these gaps and it
        is recommended to place the buttons (with the top of the button oriented to point right, similar to Figure 10), so that the left and right terminals
        connect the columns on either side of the gap.&nbsp; While this isn&#8217;t
        absolutely necessary, it will provide you more room to work.<br>
        </li>
        <li> Using three wires, connect the top
        terminal of each button to the 5V bus strip.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li> Using three more wires, connect from the
        chipKIT digital I/O pins 5, 6 and 7 to the bottom terminal of buttons A,
        B, and C.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>For each button, connect one end of a 10k-ohm
        resistor to the bottom terminal of the button.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Connect the other end of each resistor to the
        ground bus strip (you can use a wire to connect
        from the resistor to bus strip, as shown in Figure 10, or you can simply
        connect the end of the resistor to the bus strip directly).<br>
        </li>
        <li>When each button is pressed, it will supply 5 volts to the digital I/O
        pin.&nbsp; The chipKIT Max32 and Uno32 boards are designed to recognize a range from
        2.4V minimum to 5.5V maximum as a HIGH input for digital I/O pins.
        (ie when the software function digitalRead() is called, it will return a HIGH if the voltage
        on the pin being read from is within this range).  The digitalRead() function will
        be discussed later in this project. (It is important to note that the analog inputs for the Max32,
        and Uno32 can only accept a max of 3.3V).<br>

    In order to better understand what the chipKIT
    is doing in conjunction with MPIDE, it is important to
    provide a brief explanation of the <code>if</code> conditional statements and
    <code>digitalRead</code> functions before running the sketch . <br>
    <br>
    The <code>digitalRead</code> command operates much as
    one would surmise.&nbsp; When called, the user specifies a pin
    number
    in the parameters, and the function will then read the electrical state
    of the pin, and output either a HIGH or LOW constant accordingly.<br>
    <br>
    
    For example:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <code>Val = digitalRead(8);</code><br>
    <br>
    
    <code>Val</code> would store the result of the <code>digitalRead</code> function called for pin
    8.&nbsp; If pin 8 sees a high voltage level on the pin at the time
    the function
    is called, <code>Val</code> would equal HIGH, and if not <code>Val</code> would equal LOW.<br>
    <br>

    Along with supporting all of the original Arduino syntax, chipKIT
    sketches are based on C++ syntax and thus most conventions apply.<br>
    An &#8220;if&#8221; comparison statement syntax would be as follows:<br>

 <span class="TB-BODY">Within the “if” statement you can see that there is a comparison expression.
A comparison expression is much like a mathematical equation except that it evaluates only to true or false.
Like mathematical expressions, which have their own set of operators (ie  “ + , -, / and *) , comparison expressions
have their own set as well. For example a relational operators could be, “ ==” or “!=” ,  which have the meaning of
“ equal to” and “ not equal to” respectively.  Comparison expressions are formed much like math equations using these operators.
An example of a comparison expression assuming x is an int type variable, could be:
<ol>
    <li>
x == 0   
</li>
<li>
x != 0
</li>
</ol>
In expression 1, this would evaluate to true whenever the variable x would equal 0, and false for any other value.
Expression 2 would then evaluate as false if x was equal 0, and true for any other value. There are many more operators than
just “equal” and “not equal”. The following table shows a few of these relational operators.</span>
