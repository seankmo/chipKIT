		Two or more electronic components are considered to be "in series" when the
		current that flows through the first device also flows entirely though the next device,
		and so on. Using a water analogy, this would be like connecting multiple pipes together
		end to end.  Water flows from one pipe straight into the next pipe.

		Figure 1 shows a simple example of two resistors that have been placed in series with each other.
		You can see that current flowing out of R1 has no place else to go but R2.

		When analyzing a circuit (usually on paper or using computer software), it is often easier to
		simplify the circuit before proceeding with any further analysis.  Resistors placed in series
		can be conveniently summed into a resistor of equivalent value (see figure 2) and is a very
		common simplification.
