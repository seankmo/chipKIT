		Active and passive sign convention is simply a methodology for designating positive and negative terminals on two
		terminal circuit components for the purpose of easier circuit analysis.

		Active sign convention is used on devices that deliver voltage to a circuit; for instance batteries or discharging
		capacitors.  For active components the sign convention is very clear, the positive terminal is the terminal that
		delivers current (i.e. current flows out of), and the negative terminal is the terminal that current flows back into.
		On most components these terminals are clearly marked, and reversing them will provide a negative voltage. (When a
		negative voltage occurs, the voltage potential at the non-ground terminal is lower than ground’s voltage potential,
		hence negative).

		Resistors are the main components that follow passive sign convention. The point on a resistor where current flows
		into the component is considered its positive terminal, and the point where current flows out of the component is
		considered its negative terminal. 
		If one was to physically examine a resistor, they would quickly see that there is no positive or negative terminals on
		the device, (physical connector leads can even be reversed without ill effect).  Passive sign convention does not
		depend on the device itself, simple on its orientation within the circuit.  Mainly the passive sign convention is simply
		a rule to designate terminals uniformly.
