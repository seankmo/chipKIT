				<span class="TB-BODY">
				
				In the <a href="P14.cfm">previous project</a> the brightness of an LED was controlled via Pulse with modulation (PWM).
				In this project we will use PWM to control the color of a Tricolor LED. If you are not familiar with PWM it
				is recommended you review <a href="P14.cfm">Breathing LED with PWM</a>. Project 15 will be very similar to the
				previous project except the LED being used will change color. Generally LEDs are manufactured to emit one color of
				light. These colors can range from any color in the rainbow to infrared or even ultraviolet. The LEDs color is determined
				by the material it is made from and the voltage that is applied to it. Depending on the combination of the material and voltage,
				different wave lengths of light are emitted. We perceive these different wavelengths of light as colors. The Tricolor LED we will
				use can only generate red, green and blue wave lengths of light. This is because the Tricolor LED is actually consists of a red,
				green and blue led all in one bulb. By changing the intensities of each LED inside the bulb, we can generate the illusion of different
				colors. The same principle also applies when mixing paint. Mixing red and green paint results in what looks like yellow paint even
				though there is no naturally yellow pigment in the mixture. This phenomenon occurs because our brains simply perceive this combination
				of red and green pigment the same way we perceive naturally yellow pigment.  Similarly, our brains perceive the combination of red and
				green wave lengths of light, the same way the actual wave length of yellow is perceived.

				Before 	we begin putting the circuit together the structure of the Tricolor LED must be discussed.
				Since Tricolor LEDs are essentially a red, green and blue LED it would make sense to assume it will have
				3 anodes and 3 cathodes for a total of 6 legs. Realistically this isn't very practical so the red green and blue
				LEDs inside the bulb all share a common cathode to save room. This means our Tricolor LED will only have four legs as shown in Fig. 1.

					The function to <span class="TB-BLACK">setColorBrightness</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> may seem unnecessary,
					since the color can be changed directly with <span class="TB-KEYWORD2">analogWrite</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span>.
					While this is true, bear in mind that it is easy to mix up what pin number corresponds to the color we want to change.
					Using the <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">if</span> <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">else</span> tree inside of the
					<span class="TB-BLACK">setColorBrightness</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> function  allows us to modify color
					values using intuitive color abbreviations, 'r', 'g' and 'b'. Furthermore the

					In the example the <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span> values were int and char types. A
					<span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span> value can be any constant value which can be interpreted as an integer value.
					This includes the boolean constants <span class="TB-LITERAL1">HIGH</span>, <span class="TB-LITERAL1">LOW</span>, <span class="TB-LITERAL1">INPUT</span>, <span class="TB-LITERAL1">OUTPUT</span>, <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">true</span>, and <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">false</span>. Some data types that cannot be used as a
					<span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span> values are doubles, floats, strings and arrays. On top of being careful with the
					<span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span>'s data type, it is also important to be attentive about including <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">break</span>
					lines at the end of every <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span>. If you forget to add a <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">break</span>
					in a specific <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span>, the <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">switch</span> statement will execute

					So far <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">switch</span> statements and <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">if</span> <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">else</span>
					trees appear to do the same thing. While this is true, there are distinct advantages and disadvantages when using <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">
					switch</span> statements. We know that <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">switch</span> statements have limited use because they cannot compare
					dynamic variables and are restricted to specific data types. On the other hand <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">switch</span> statements
					compare only one <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span> making them very efficient. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the differences in efficiency
					between <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">if</span> <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">else</span> trees and <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">switch</span> statements.

						Similar to our Basic Color Control code we will use a single function, <span class="TB-BLACK">changeColorBrightness</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span>,

						<br><br>
						
						The while loop increments or decrements the brightness of a color until it reaches the limit of the PWM pin. Each iteration of the loop
						is delayed so we have time to watch the color fade. The code given above should make the LED fade from red, to purple, to blue,
						to aqua blue, and finally to green. 
						
						<br><br>
						The sweep sequence is determined by the order in which the red, green, and blue LEDs are faded in and out. You can try rearranging the order to get different color combinations.

						Uploading the sketch to your chipKIT should make the tricolor LED randomly jump to new colors. The time between each jump is
						determined by the delay inside of the <span class="TB-KEYWORD3">loop</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> function. You may
						notice some of the colors appear very dim. This is because inside of each <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span>, random(256) has
						returned a value near 0. You can try experimenting with different min values for the random function to prevent dim colors. You
						can also specifically tweak the min values in cases 3 through 6. Currently these cases have the possibility of generating a single
						primary color like red, assuming the other colors in the <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span> are randomly assigned a value near zero.

					Now that we know how to generate random color combinations and implement color sweeps we can combine the two concepts. In this section we
					will write some code to randomly select a color sweep sequence. Here the order of the sequence will matter. This means there will be 6 different
					color sequences all of which are listed below.

					Each  sequence will be implemented as a <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">switch</span> statement <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span>. 
					The <span class="TB-KEYWORD1">case</span> will be selected by using the <span class="TB-KEYWORD2">random</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span>

					<span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> function we wrote in the color sweeps section to fade the colors in or out. The code needed to implement this is shown below
					inside of the <span class="TB-BLACK">randomColorSweep</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> function.

					Once this code is uploaded the tricolor LED should randomly sweep through different color sequences. The sequence's fade time can be
					tweaked by changing a variable inside of the <span class="TB-BLACK">randomColorSweep</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> function.
					By default it delays five milliseconds between each incrimination of a colors brightness. This is done using
					<span class="TB-KEYWORD2">delay</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> called within <span class="TB-BLACK">changeColorBrightness</span>
					<span class="TB-BLACK">()</span>. If you want to delay for periods less than a millisecond you can replace
					the <span class="TB-KEYWORD2">delay</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span> line with <span class="TB-KEYWORD2">delayMicroseconds</span>
					<span class="TB-BLACK">(fadeTime)</span> for greater precision. Remember that 1 millisecond is equal to 1000 microseconds, so using delay times
					less than 300, with <span class="TB-KEYWORD2">delayMicroseconds</span><span class="TB-BLACK">()</span>, will make the LED flash rather than fade.
