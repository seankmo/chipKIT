				<span class="TB-BODY"> 
				In the <a href="P14.cfm">previous project</a> the brightness of an LED was controlled via Pulse with modulation (PWM). In this project we will use PWM to control the color of a Tricolor LED. If you are not familiar with PWM it is recommended you review <a href="P14.cfm">Breathing LED with PWM</a>. Project 15 will be very similar to the previous project except the LED being used will change color. Generally LEDs are manufactured to emit one color of light. These colors can range from any color in the rainbow to infrared or even ultraviolet. The LEDs color is determined by the material it is made from and the voltage that is applied to it. Depending on the combination of the material and voltage, different wave lengths of light are emitted. We perceive these different wavelengths of light as colors. The Tricolor LED we will use can only generate red, green and blue wave lengths of light. This is because the Tricolor LED is actually consists of a red, green and blue led all in one bulb. By changing the intensities of each LED inside the bulb, we can generate the illusion of different colors. The same principle also applies when mixing paint. Mixing red and green paint results in what looks like yellow paint even though there is no naturally yellow pigment in the mixture. This phenomenon occurs because our brains simply perceive this combination of red and green pigment the same way we perceive naturally yellow pigment.  Similarly, our brains perceive the combination of red and green wave lengths of light, the same way the actual wave length of yellow is perceived.

				Before 	we begin putting the circuit together the structure of the Tricolor LED must be discussed. Since Tricolor LEDs are essentially a red, green and blue LED it would make sense to assume it will have  3 anodes and 3 cathodes for a total of 6 legs. Realistically this isn't very practical so the red green and blue LEDs inside the bulb all share a common cathode to save room. This means our Tricolor LED will only have four legs as shown in Fig. 1.
