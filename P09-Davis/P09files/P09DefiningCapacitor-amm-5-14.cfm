	<span class="TB-BODY"> <!--this is a comment --> A capacitor is an
	  electronic component that stores energy in the form of an
	  electric field. Without delving too deeply into the physics of
	  electricity, capacitors achieve an electric field by accumulating
	  charge on two conductive plates at different voltages (as in
	  Fig. 1). These conductive plates are separated by a special type
	  of insulator called a <i>dielectric</i>.  Different factors, like the
	  properties of the dielectric, area of the plate, and the distance
	  between the plates,  affect how much energy can be stored.  The
	  amount of energy that can be stored is measured in Farads.
	  Capacitors typically hold somewhere between a few picofarads (pF;
	  one picofarad is 10<sup>-12</sup> of a Farad) to hundereds of
	  microfarads (&micro;F one microfarad is 10<sup>-6</sup> of a
	  Farad). Large capacitors that hold tens of farads or more are
	  referred to as “super-capacitors” or
	  “ultra-capacitors”. They are not very common due to their
	  impractical size. Using one would be comparable to building a car
	  with 1000 gallon gas tank.  <br/><br/><br/>

	        Analogy: Elastic wall in a pipe<br/> Unit: Farads (F), a
	        Farad equals one Columb / Volt<br/> Equation Variable: C
	        <br/><br/> Brief Description:<br/> It is difficult to
	        understand how a capacitor reacts in a circuit based by
	        trying to theorize it.  It is simpler to describe its
	        properties using a water analogy. Capacitors work very
	        similar to an elastic wall sealed in the middle of a pipe.
	        When this hydraulic capacitor is placed between a pressure
	        drop, the elastic divider will stretch and store the
	        energy. The hydraulic capacitor analogy illustrates a few
	        important properties of capacitors.

				    <li>As charge accumulates on one plate in an electric
					    capacitor, the electric field increases, expelling
					    an equal amount of charge from the other
					    plate. Similarly, as the elastic in the hydraulic
					    capacitor expands to make room for the water being
					    pumped in. The elastic also must push an equal
					    amount of water out the other side (see
					    Fig. 2).<br></li>
					    
				    <li>As an electric capacitor charges, the voltage drop
					    across its terminals approaches the voltage applied
					    to it by the circuit. Similarly, as the elastic in
					    a hydraulic capacitor stretches further, it will
					    begin to press back with greater force. Eventually,
					    it will press back with enough force to be equal to
					    the pressure drop applied by the system, as in
					    Fig. 3.<br></li>
			  
				    <li> Once an electric capacitor is fully charged, it
					    will look like a gap in a circuit, or a resistor
					    with infinite resistance. This is because once
					    fully charged, no DC current can flow through a
					    capacitor. The same thing happens with a hydraulic
					    capacitor. As the elastic stretches it pushes water
					    out one side, creating a flow. Once the elastic has
					    stretched to equal the pressure of the system, it
					    will stop moving. At this point the elastic cannot
					    displace any more water (as shown in Fig. 2). Since
					    no water can breach the stretched barrier, no
					    liquid can flow through the fully charged
					    capacitor.<br></li>

			  <span class="TB-BODY"> <!--this is a comment --> There are
				  many different kinds of capacitors. This is because a
				  wide variety of different materials can be used for the
				  dielectric. Both electrolytic capacitors and ceramic

				  them.

				  <br/><br/>
				  
				  <u>Electrolytic Capacitors</u><br/><br/><!--maybe make this text wrap around the image?--> 

				  Electrolytic capacitors are the most common type of
				  capacitor. Generally, they are cylindrical in shape and
				  are used when the circuit calls for a large
				  capacitance. Electrolytic capacitors have a polarity, so
				  they must be connected correctly to avoid damage. The
				  negative side of the capacitor is denoted by a white
				  stripe. The capacity and maximum voltage values are also
				  printed directly on the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 4.

				  <u>Ceramic Capacitors</u><br/><br/> 

				  Ceramic capacitors are much smaller than
				  electrolytic capacitors. Generally, they are shaped like
				  small disks and have no polarity.  Their capacitance is
				  printed as a code on the component. The code will either
				  be two or three digits and may have a tolerance letter
				  on the end (see Fig. 5).

				  ceramic capacitor codes indicate the capacitor value in
				  pico Farads (pF). Two digit codes do not need to be
				  decoded, as they simply specify what the capacitance is
				  in pF.  Three digit codes work the same way (the first
				  two digits represent a number not a code), except the
				  third digit represents the power by which you should
				  multiply (see Fig. 6). Finally, a letter on the end of a
				  three digit code designates the tolerance (also shown in
				  Fig.  6). Capacitor tolerance is how much accepted error
				  there is in the capacitance value due to the
				  manufacturing process. Below are some examples of
				  converting capacitor codes to their values.  <br/><br/>
