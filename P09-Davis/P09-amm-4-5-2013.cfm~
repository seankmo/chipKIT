			In <a href="P07.cfm">Project 07</a>
			we have seen how to debounce a button in a circuit with software. Other solutions to this problem also exist. 
			In this project we will now examine how do debounce the button input using a resistor and capacitor to make a 
			RC filter (Resistive Capacitive filter). The key component here is the capacitor, which is  a device that stores energy using electrical charge. It is important to understand how a capacitor works so there is <a href="P09files/P09What is a capacitor.cfm">more reading on capacitors here</a>.
			The reason a capacitor works well for debouching is due to the fact it limits how fast the voltage can change over a period 
			of time. Essentially the capacitor quickly charges and discharges over every voltage spike smoothing out the button bounce. Depending on how fast the capacitor can charge, the button bounce will be smoothed out more or less. Referring back to the <a href="P09files/P09What is a capacitor.cfm#WaterAnalogy">water analogy</a>, the elastic wall in the hydraulic capacitor can only stretch so 
			fast. If the incoming water is moving too quickly the elastic will slow it down. Similarly the rapid voltage 
			spikes caused by the bouncing button are slowed down to the capacitors maximum charge/discharge speed.    <br/>

				To debounce the button properly we cannot use a capacitor alone, a resistor must be used as well. The 
				combination of a resistor and capacitor in this circuit is referred to as an RC filter. RC filters can 
				be used to filter out different frequencies of electrical variation. A properly designed RC filter could 
				be used to filter out specific sound frequencies (represented as electrical signals) being sent to a sent to a speaker. This however is a bit beyond the scope 
				of our project.  Instead we are going to be focusing on the charge, and discharge time of our RC circuit. 
				We can control the rate at which the voltage changes by choosing our Resistor and Capacitor values properly to get a 
				good time constant. For this project we will use a 10K ohm resistor and a 10 &micro;F capacitor. 
				Here is an explanation of what a time constant is and <a href="P09files/P09ChoosingRC.cfm">how the R and C values were determined</a> from it.

			Now that the circuit has been built, you can test the de-bouncing properties of the RC filter. Plug the USB cable into 
			your chipKIT board and program it with code from <a href="P06.cfm">project 6</a>. Once your board is programmed the external LED should start 
			blinking.

			Remove the capacitor form your circuit; it's okay to do this while the circuit has power.
			We know it's okay to do this because we understand how it will affect the circuit. Removing the capacitor is equivalent to replacing 
			it with a gap in the circuit. Since nothing can flow across this gap more current will be diverted through the resistor that was in parallel with the capacitor.  
			Similarly, once the capacitor has been charged in the circuit it will not allow any current to flow through it. At this point the capacitor will essentially act as a gap. 
			Since we understand the removal of the capacitor is harmless we can do it while the power is on. It is not a good idea to swap our components if you don't know what will happen.
			After you have removed the capacitor pressing the button enough times should eventually cause a button bounce and make the LED dimly glow.  Tapping of flicking 
			the button should guarantee somthing similar to a bounce to occur. Once you are able to reproduce the bounce consistently try sticking the 
			capacitor back in the circuit. Be sure you <b>put the capacitor back exactly how it is shown</b> in Fig. 1. with the white stripe terminal connected to ground. If you reconnect the capacitor with 
			the wrong polarity it could damage your component. With the capacitor back in place you should not be able to get the button 
			to bounce even if you flick or tap it.

					As you can see the capacitor has dramatically limited the rate at which voltage can change,

					we chose were specifically meant to reduce bounce noise and any other noise caused by a tap/flick.
