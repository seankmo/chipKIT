            In this project, you will be introduced to MPIDE (the
            Multi-Platform Integrated Development Environment) which
            is software that can be used to program chipKIT boards.
            Programs written for MPIDE are called
            &ldquo;sketches&rdquo;.  (We will often use the
            term <i>code</i> or <i>computer code</i> to refer to all
            or part of a sketch.  Note that this
            &ldquo;<i>code</i>&rdquo; has nothing to do with a secret
            code even though some of it my initially appear somewhat
            mysterious!) In order to demonstrate how to use MPIDE with
            your chipKIT board, you will run one of the example
            sketches that is provided within MPIDE.
	    
	    <br/> <br/>
	    
	    A brief discussion of the components used in this project
            is provided below.  Links to slightly more detailed
            descriptions of the various components are provided in the
            subsections below.  <br/><br/><br/>

            <span class="TB-BODY">
             MPIDE is free software that can be downloaded
             from <a href="https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX/downloads">here</a>.
	     <font color="red">JBS: We need either additional
	       information or additional pages (one for each operating
	       system?) to guide the reader through installation and
	       start-up.</font>  To run the program, click to open and
	       begin your download. After it has finished downloading,
	       unzip the file. Double-click the file to open it.

              <ol class="TB-BODY">

		<p>
		
               	<li> Connect your cable to your computer and your
               	board. The driver will automatically begin
               	installing. <font color="red">JBS: What's a driver?  Does
               	the reader need to know what this means?  If not, this
               	should be stated differently.  If they should
               	understand this, explain it.</font>  Once it has
               	installed, small red and green lights should be
               	illuminated on the board (technically these are
               	&ldquo;light emitting diodes&rdquo; and in the
               	reference material for the board are referred to as
               	LED3, which is red, and LED4, which is green). Open
               	the folders and click on the application to run
               	it. <font color="red">JBS: I'm not sure which folders the
               	user is supposed to open.  Are they supposed to open
               	more than one?  Also, by "application" do we simply
               	mean MPIDE?  Also, the following figure needs to be
               	tied into the narrative, i.e., it needs to be
               	explained.  When does it appear?</font>
		<div align="center">
		  <img src="openfile.png"/>
		</div>
		Fig. 1 is indicative of the window you should see
after MPIDE has started.  <font color="red">JBS: We need to think about the
use of numbered figures versus figures that simply appear at the
"correct spot" in the narrative flow.  I generally like to have all
figures numbered and to be provided with a caption.  We may discover
that numbering every figure is overkill, but we should provide a
caption for ever figure.  Norm can probably help with implementing
this.
</font> The central (white) portion of the window is where you enter
computer code, i.e., enter your sketch.  MPIDE provides a default name
for the sketch which is of the form:
&ldquo;sketch_<i>dateletter</i>&rdquo; where <i>dateletter</i> is the
date (with a three-letter representation of the month and the numeric
value for the day) followed by a letter.  When you try to save your
sketch, this is the name that will be associated with the saved file
unless you indicate you want to name it something else.  (As an aside,
if you open additional new windows on the same day, and stick with the
default naming, the letter at the end of the file name changes.  You
can open 26 new windows this way.  If you try for a 27th sketch,
you're told to it may be time to take a break!  However, you should
provide more descriptive names for your sketches and, by doing so, you
can open any number of sketches in the same day.)
</li>

		<p>

                <li>Because the purpose of this project is to introduce
                you to MPIDE and demonstrate how to use it, rather
                than teach you to write your own sketch, we will use
                one of the example sketches that comes with MPIDE.

		  <p>

                Select the menu entry
                <tt>File>Examples>1.Basics>Blink</tt>.  This will open
a new window in which the code for the sketch appears.  In the
"header" portion of the window the name of the file in which the code
is stored will appear.  In this example the file name is "Blink" (on
the computer this is stored as <tt>Blink.pde</tt>; the extension
of <tt>.pde</tt> indicates this file is a sketch).
		</li>

		<div align="center">
		  <img src="blinkexample.png" />
		</div>

		  <p>

		    At this point we have a sketch, i.e., a set of
		    computer instruction, loaded into MPIDE.  But,
		    this information has not been transfered to the
		    chipKIT board.  Keep in mind that MPIDE runs on
		    your computer and allows us to transfer
		    information from your computer to the chipKIT
		    boards (and, as will see later, allows us to
		    transfer information from the chipKIT boards back
		    to your computer).  You can, in fact, start MPIDE
		    without a chipKIT attached to your computer.  You
		    might want to do this if you are writing a sketch
		    but not yet ready to run it on a board.  The next
		    steps describe what needs to be done to transfer
		    the instructions in a sketch to a chipKIT board.


               	<li>
MPIDE can be use with a great variety of board but it needs to know
the type of board it is supposed to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to.
To do this, as indicated below, select the menu <tt>Tools>Board</tt>
and the type of your particular chipKIT board.

<p>

Next, go to <tt>Tools>Serial Port</tt> and select the proper serial
port. <div align="center"><img src="boardselect.png"/></div> This is
usually usually COM3 or higher. An easy way to learn which serial port
is the correct one is to disconnect your chipKIT board. The correct
option will have disappeared from the dropdown menu. Reconnect your
board and select that serial
port.<div align="center"><img src="2serialport2.png"/></div></li>

          <span class="TB-BODY">
            We are now almost at the point where we can run the
            sketch. Normally, before uploading the sketch, you would
            &ldquo;verify&ldquo; the sketch to identify any bugs or errors in the
            code.  This can be accomplished by in on of three way.  As
            indicated in the figure below, you can click on the button
            corresponding to Verify.  Alternatively, you can click on
            the menu entry <tt>Sketch>Verify/Compile</tt> or you can
            type <tt>Ctrl+R</tt> (i.e., hold down the control key and
            then type the key R).

	    <p>

	      You are certainly welcome to verify this sketch, but
	      since this was one of the provided example sketches,
	      this isn't necessary.

JBS: Although I think the following should be somewhere in our
material, it does seem a little out of place here.  Perhaps we can
move this to the next project.

JBS: We need to describe what the sketch actually does.  What is the
result of uploading this sketch?  What will the board do?  What will
the reader see?

Also, need to explain what the other "tool bar" buttons do.  There
shouldn't be a figure without a corresponding description in the text.
