          <span class="TB-BODY">
            In this project, we will introduce you to chipKIT's MPIDE. 
	MPIDE (Multi-Platform Integrated Development Environment) is software that can 
	be used to program chipKIT boards. Programs written for MPIDE are called "sketches." (We
	will often use the term <i>code</i> or <i>computer code</i> to refer to all or part of a
	sketch. Note that this "<i>code</i>" has nothing to do with a secret code even though some of 
	it may initially appear mysterious!) You will run one of the example sketches provided in
	MPIDE in order to show how to use MPIDE with your chipKIT board.  <br/><br/> A
            brief discussion of the components used in this project is
            provided below.  Links to slightly more detailed
            descriptions of the various components are provided in the
            subsections below.  <br/><br/><br/>

            To begin, have a USB A to mini B cable (see Figure 1) ready to connect to your computer and your chipKIT board.

            <span class="TB-BODY">
             MPIDE is a free software that is available <a href="https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX/downloads">here</a>. 
		Keep in mind that this page is a guide to downloading in Windows; if you're downloading  MPIDE for Mac OS X, see our <a href="https://dummypageformac">page</a> that provides directions for that operating system. 
		To download MPIDE for Linux, follow our directions <a href="https://linuxdummypage">here</a>.
		To begin downloading, click on the option for Windows (it will be one of the first few options listed - see Figure 3). Follow the system's prompts. After it has finished downloading, unzip the file. 
		To unzip a file, double-click on the zipped file and follow the prompts. You can also find more information on the <a href="http://www.chipkit.net/started/">chipKIT website</a>.

          <span class="TB-H1">Step 2: Running the Sketch</span> <br/><br/>
              <ol class="TB-BODY">
               	<li>Connect your cable to your computer and your board. The driver (a piece of the software that facilitates 
		communication between the software and device's hardware) will begin installing automatically. 
		Once it has installed, small red and green lights should be illuminated on the board. (Technically, these 
		are "light emitting diodes." In the reference material for the board [the Uno32], they are referred to as LED3, 
		which is red, and LED4, which is green.) Double-click on the MPIDE folder and click on MPIDE to run it. The MPIDE 
		file should be in your Downloads folder (or whatever location you saved it to). Figure 4 shows the window you will 
		see after clicking on MPIDE.
		<div align="center">
		  <img src="openfile.png"/>
		<div class="TB-FIGURES">Fig. 4. This window will pop up when you click on MPIDE. Click Run.</div>
		</div><br>
		<p>
			The central
	 		(white) portion of the window is where you enter computer code, i.e., enter your sketch. Figure 5 shows a basic sketch.<br/>
		<div align="center">
		  <img src="opensketch.png" /><br/>
		<div class="TB-FIGURES">Fig. 5. After starting MPIDE, you should see a window like this.</div>
		</div><br>
			MPIDE 
			provides a default name for the sketch which is of the form: “sketch_<i>dateletter</i>” where <i>dateletter</i> 	
			is the date (with a three-letter representation of the month and the numeric value for the day) 
			followed by a letter. When you try to save your sketch, this is the name that will be associated 
			with the saved file unless you indicate that you want to name it something else. (As an aside, if you 
			open additional new windows on the same day, and stick with the default naming, the letter at the 
			end of the file name changes. You can open 26 new windows this way. If you try for a 27th sketch, 
			you're told it may be time to take a break! However, you should provide more descriptive names 
			for your sketches. By doing so, you can open any number of sketches in the same day!)</p></li>
                <li>Since the purpose of this project is to introduce you to MPIDE rather than teach you to write your own sketch, we are going to use an example sketch that comes with MPIDE. 
		Select the menu entry <code>File>Open>examples>1.Basics>Blink>Blink.</code> This will open a new window where the sketch's code appears. 
		In the "header" portion of the windown, the name of the file where the code is stored will appear. In this example, the file name is "Blink" 
		(on the computer this is stored as <code>Blink.pde</code>; the extension "<code>.pde</code>" indicates that this file is a sketch).
		Figure 6, shown below, is what this should look like.<br><br>

		</div>
		<p>Now we have a sketch, or a set of
		    computer instructions, loaded into MPIDE.  However,
		    this information has not been transfered to the
		    chipKIT board.  Keep in mind that MPIDE runs on
		    your computer and allows you to transfer
		    information from your computer to the chipKIT
		    boards (and as you will see later, allows us to
		    transfer information from the chipKIT boards back
		    to your computer).  You can, in fact, start MPIDE
		    without a chipKIT attached to your computer.  You
		    might want to do this if you are writing a sketch
		    but are not yet ready to run it on a board.  The next
		    steps describe what needs to be done to transfer
		    the instructions in a sketch to a chipKIT board.</p>
               	<li>You can use MPIDE with a wide variety of boards, but it needs 
		to know they type of board it is "talking" to. To do this, select the
		menu <code>Tools>Board</code> and choose your chipKIT board (shown below in Figure 7).
		<div align="center">
		<img src="boardselect.png"/>
		<div class="TB-FIGURES">Fig. 7. Selecting your chipKIT board.</div></div>
		<p>Next, go to <code>Tools>Serial Port</code> to select the proper serial port (see Figure 8). 
		This is usually COM3 or higher. An easy way to learn which serial port is the 
		correct one is to disconnect your chipKIT board. The correct option will have 
		disappeared from the dropdown menu. Reconnect your board and select that serial port.</p>

            Now you are almost ready to run the sketch. Normally, before uploading the sketch, 
	you would "verify" the sketch to identify any bugs or errors in the code. This can be accomplished in 
	three ways. As indicated in the figure below, you can click the corresponding Verify button. 
	Alternatively, you can click on the menu entry <code>Sketch>Verify/Compile</code> or you can type 
	<code>Ctrl+R</code> (hold down the control key and type the key R). While you are welcome to verify 
	this sketch, but since it is one of the provided example sketches, this isn't necessary. Figure 9 shows
	some of the other tools available in MPIDE.

	You can also click on the menu entry <code>File>Upload to I/O Board</code> (I/O stands for input/output),
 	or type <code>Ctrl+U</code>. Once the sketch has uploaded, the other two light emitting diodes on the board 
	(LED1 and LED2) should start to blink! They will continue to blink until you remove the board from its power source.
