	<p>In this project a user will set up a single button and external LED much like that of Project 4: button controlled LEDs,
	except now the LED will blink at a rate adjustable by the user.  Initially the LED will blink at a rate of half a second.
	By pressing and holding down the button, the user will set or “train” the amount of delay between when the LED changes from
	on to off (and vice versa off to on), by the amount of time the button is pressed.  For example holding down the button for
	three seconds, would then cause the LED to blink at a rate of 3 seconds on, 3 seconds off.   </span></p>

	  <p>The first function we will make use of in this project is the millis() function.  When the millis() function is called it
	  will return the number of milliseconds (as an integer value) since the program has started to run. We will use this function to capture the length of time that a button has been pressed. 
	  This can be done by calling millis() the first time the button has been pressed, and calling it again after the button has been released.
	  Subtracting the two returned values will give us the duration. </span>

	<br><span class="TB-BODY">
	  <p>While not used in this project, micros() is very similar to millis()
	  except that it returns the microsecond value since the program has been running,
	  instead of a millisecond value.For calculating the duration of button presses, measuring in the millisecond range is perfectly adequate.
	  There are several instances when greater accuracy is needed though. For instances, if we wanted to capture the duration that an external
	  signal produced by a sensor was asserted.  It is common for sensors to change their output signal faster than a millisecond, so in order to
	  capture the duration of these events, more accuracy is need. </span></p>

	  <p><span class="TB-BODY">The while loop stems from C/C++ syntax and operates in the same fashion.
	  When a while loop starts, it checks the comparison expression within 
	  its parentheses and executes the loop if the comparison evaluates to true.
	  The conditional expressions used by the “While” loop
	  are the same expressions used by the “if” statement (to review these operators
	  reference project 4).
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>When the conditional statement evaluates to true,all of the code between the brackets will be run. Once this segment of code finishes executing, it
	  checks the conditional statement again.  If the statement is still true, it will
	  loop again through the segment of code within the brackets. It will to continue loop
	  in this way until the conditional statement evaluates to be false.
	  Keep in mind if the conditional statement never evaluates as false, the while loop will run
	  indefinitely.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Here is an example of a while loop
	  <br>
	  <br></span>
	  
	    <div align="center">
    <cf_box color="white" style="width:95%; margin:8em 0 8em 0 ">
    <pre class="brush: mpide; gutter: false; toolbar: false;">
	    int Sum = 0;
	    While (Sum  != 100){
	    Sum++;
	    }
</pre>
</cf_box>
</div>
	  <br>

	    <p><span class="TB-BODY">After this segment of code has run Sum will be equal to 100.
	    The variable Sum starts at 0 so the conditional statement in the while loop evaluates to true. The code between the loop's brackets is then executed adding 1 to Sum. (In C/C++ syntax , Sum++ is 
		equivalent to writing Sum = Sum + 1). The conditional statement is checked again and the process repeats  until Sum is equal to 100, exiting the loop.
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    
	    <p>
	      The strength and usefulness of while loops come into play when the exact number of loop iterations depends on unknown circumstances.  For example, the following code illustrates this.
	      While the buttonState (the variable that stores the HIGH/LOW state of a button) is in the LOW state, the while loop will iterate a counter. Once the button is pressed (setting buttonState HIGH with the digitalRead function called for pin 10),
	      the while condition will be proven true, and then exit the loop. The count variable will represent the millisecond value prior to the button being pressed.
	      Since this statement is dependent on an external signal it will run for a variable and unknown length of time.</span>

	<p>Overall when the sketch is downloaded to the chipKIT board, it should initially start to blink at a delay rate of .5 seconds.
	When the button is pressed the delay value will be calculated the moment the button is released.You can now observe the LED
	starting to blink at the new delay rate.<br>
	
	One pitfall/condition of this circuit that needs to be mentioned is that on occasion pressing the button will cause the LED
	to glow very dimly and not blink as expected.  This happens because of the a physical characteristics of the button itself known as <i>“bounce”</i>.<br>  

	When mechanical buttons or switches are pressed (or thrown), the transition from on/off (and likewise off/on) is not clean or instantaneous
	. This is because after being pressed the button vibrates and “bounces”, randomly making electrical contact. The random electrical variation (also referred to as electrical noise)
	caused by this bouncing action can sometimes be interpreted as a very fast button press.  </span>

	<p>Figure 2 is a graph of voltage over time, where every vertical division is represented by 100 microseconds. The graph shows the electrical noise created by a button (identical to the ones
	used in this project) being released. You can see that there is a period of about 400 microseconds where there is a slight amount of noise on
	the transitioning signal. How this causes the original problem of the dim LED is that the chipKIT board's main loop runs so fast 
	it can read the voltage fluctuations during this transition period, and has a chance of misinterpreting them. Ie a chipKIT board reading a digital input might read a sudden dip in the voltage on the input pin as a LOW signal,
	and then a few microseconds later read the signal as HIGH  (and then LOW again once the fluctuations finally settle) .
	The chipKIT could interrupt this as random button presses with a duration of only a few microseconds. This would end up setting the blink delay to
	an inordinately small amount.  When the LED is dim, it is actually trying to blink at an incredibly fast rate.  Between the LED not being able to keep up at this rate, and human
	vision not being able to distinguish such a fast rate of change (think of a motion pictures were our brains merge a sequence of images because it changes so fast), we observe the
	LED as dim instead of constantly changing.</p><br>
	
	While this does not happened on every single press of a button, it does happen often enough that one needs to be wary of it. Various hardware and software
	solutions for correcting button bounce will be introduced in the forthcoming projects. For this project is it simple adequate to be aware that such a
	condition exists, and how it can affect a circuit.</span>
