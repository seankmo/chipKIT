		In the <a href="P01.html">Introduction to MPIDE</a> you
	    used an example sketch that was provided
	    in MPIDE to blink one of the on-board LEDs (light
	    emitting diodes).  In this project, the goal is once again to
	    obtain a sketch that will blink the same on-board LED, but
	    rather than loading an example, we now want to write the
	    sketch ourselves&mdash;and understand what we wrote!
	    Along the way, you will also become more familiar with
	    MPIDE.

		  <br><br>
		  <span class="TB-BODY">
		Signals convey information.  We are equipped to
		receive signals in various ways.  We can receive
		auditory signals through our ears, visual signals
		through our eyes, signals of touch
		through <font color="red">nerves in our skin</font>,
		etc.  We can also store and convey information in
		different ways.  We can write in a book, we can sound
		an alarm, and we can even make smoke signals.  In the
		late eighteenth century, people realized they could
		use electrical devices to transmit
		information&mdash;they could use electrical signals.
		These electrical signals, coupled with the advances in
		technology over the past 200 years, have resulted in
		the &ldquo;Information Age&rdquo; in which we now
		live.

		    <p>

		Electrical signals are classified as being of one of
		two types: either <i>digital signals</i> or <i>analog
		signals</i>.  Analog signals are ones that
		vary continuously over time.  In contrast, digital signals vary
		discontinuously from one level to another.  The most
		common form of digital signals are <i>binary</i>,
		meaning they vary between only two different levels
		that we often refer to as HIGH and LOW.  Another name
		for a level is <i>state</i>, so that a signal may be said to
		be in either a HIGH state or a LOW state.  In addition
		to calling them HIGH and LOW, these binary states are
		sometimes called one and zero, on and off, or even
		true and false.

		<p>

		  chipKIT boards are inherently digital devices even
		  though, as we will see, they can work with analog
		  signals.  These boards are equipped with a large
		  number of electrical connectors known
		  as <i>pins</i>.  Sometimes these pins are used to
		  obtain input (i.e., &ldquo;read&rdquo; an electrical
		  signal) and sometimes they are used to generate
		  output (i.e., &ldquo;write&rdquo; an electrical
		  signal).  We can configure the pins for
		  input or output and thus they are sometimes refered
		  to as <i>I/O pins</i>.

		  <p>

		  When it comes to producing output, we, as the
		  programmers of the boards, can specify which pins
		  should be HIGH, which should be LOW, and when the
		  pins should be in these different states.  One of the
		  pins on the chipKIT boards is already associated with an
		  LED.  For now, the important thing to keep in mind
		  is that when this pin is HIGH the LED is on, and when
		  it is LOW the LED will be off.

          <span class="TB-H1">MPIDE Basics</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="TB-BODY">
	    The language that MPIDE uses is based on the C++
	    programming language (read C++ as
	    &ldquo;C-plus-plus&rdquo;).  The language C++ was
	    developed from the language C <font color="red">which
	    dates back to the late 1960's</font>.  C++ subsumes C,
	    meaning that everything you can do in C you can do with
	    equivalent statements in C++.  (However, the inverse is
	    not true.)  If you are not familiar with either C or C++,
	    you should read the introduction to the basic syntax of
	    these
	    languages <a href="P02files/P02Cbasics.html">here</a>.

	    <br><br> In C++, every program must have a function
	    named <code>main()</code>.  However, in MPIDE, you do not
	    have to write the <code>main()</code> function
	    yourself <font color="red">because one has already been
	    written for you.  In fact, not only has one been written
	    for you, but you do not have access to it.</font>
	    Instead, you must define the define two
	    functions: <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code>.
	    <font color="red">
	      (You will learn the specifics of how to define these
	      functions later in this project.)
	    </font>

	    <p>

	    The <code>setup()</code> function is run once at
	    the <font color="red">start of</font> execution of your
	    sketch <font color="red">(i.e., when you sketch first
	    starts to run)</font>.  The statements in this function
	    are typically used to
	    perform <font color="red">&ldquo;one-time&rdquo;</font>
	    set-up operations <font color="red">such as
	    specifying</font> which pins should be used for input or
	    output <font color="red">or specifying the speed of
	    communication between your chipKIT board and the
	    computer</font>. This is explained in greater detail
	    below. 

	    <br><br> 

	    <font color="red">
	    In contrast, the <code>loop()</code> function is called
	    &ldquo;continuously.&rdquo; By continuously, we mean that
	    once all the statements in the function have been executed
	    and the function <i>returns</i>, the function is
	    immediately called again.  This cycle repeats until the
	    board loses power or until it is reprogrammed.</font>
	    The <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> functions
	    will be discussed in more detail below.  (It is worth
	    noting that most of the sketches written for Arduino
	    boards can be used in MPIDE with the chipKIT boards.)

            <span class="TB-BODY">
              You will begin this project by creating
	      the <code>setup()</code> function.
	      The <code>setup()</code> function doesn't return
	      anything, so its return type <font color="red">is</font>
	      <code>void</code>. Also, the <code>setup()</code>
	      function has no inputs, so nothing should
	      go <font color="red">between</font> the parentheses.
	      Thus, <font color="red">a template for
	      the <code>setup()</code> function in which the body is
	      empty is</font>
<pre class="brush: mpide;">
void setup()
{
  // Body of function.
}
</pre>
<font color="red">Within the <code>setup()</code> function, you will
use the function
<code>pinMode()</code> to tell the board that you wish to use a pin a
certain way (<code>pinMode()</code> may appear in other places in your
sketch, but it is frequently called from within <code>setup()</code>).
This function takes two arguments corresponding to a pin (we must
specify the pin number) and the <i>mode</i> for that pin.  The mode is
either <code>INPUT</code> or <code>OUTPUT</code>.  When set
to <code>INPUT</code>, we can &ldquo;read&rdquol signals from the pin.
Conversely, when the mode is set to <code>OUTPUT</code>, we can
&ldquo;write&rdquo; to the pin.  Keep in mind that we can only
write <code>HIGH</code> or <code>LOW</code>.  When we write one of
these values (using a function we'll describe in a little while), that
establishes the pin's state.  If we write <code>HIGH</code>, the pin
will be maintained at a &ldquo;high&rdquo; voltage of 3.3 V.  On the
other hand, if we write <code>LOW</code>, the pin will be maintained
at a &ldquo;low&rdquo; voltage of 0 V.  These voltages are maintained
until a different value is written to the pin.

<p>

On the chipKIT boards, one of the internal LED's is tied to pin 13.
(When pin 13 is <code>HIGH</code>, this LED is illuminated.  When pin
13 is <code>LOW</code>, this LED is off.)  We want to configure pin 13
for <code>OUTPUT</code> so that you can effectively
&ldquo;write&rdquo; to the LED.  Thus, we need to have the following
statement in the body of the <code>setup()</code> function:
<pre class="brush: mpide; toolbar: false;">
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
</pre>
Within MPIDE <code>OUTPUT</code> and <code>INPUT</code>, though they
appears as words, are actually are a particular kind of constant,
essentially constants with names.  But, hidden from us is the fact
that they have numeric values values that cannot be changed while the
program is running.  The <code>setup()</code> function should now look
like this:
<pre class="brush: mpide; toolbar: false;">
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}
</pre>

<p>

Now that you've finished writing the <code>setup()</code> function,
you can focus on creating the <code>loop()</code> function that the
board will continuously run.  To make the LED blink, you will need two
more functions.  The first is <code>digitalWrite()</code> and the
second is <code>delay()</code>.  The <code>digitalWrite()</code>
function requires two arguments.  The first argument is the pin to
which you're writing, and the second input is the pin's state which is
either <code>HIGH</code> or <code>LOW</code>. Thus, the function cal
that sets pin 13 to <code>HIGH</code> should look like this:
<pre class="brush: mpide; toolbar: false;">
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
</pre>
And similarily, to set pin 13 to <code>LOW</code>, it should look like
this:
<pre class="brush: mpide; toolbar: false;">
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
</pre>

<p>

The <code>delay()</code> function takes only one argument which is the
time, in milliseconds, to delay.  By &ldquo;delay&rdquo; we mean the
board simply does nothing for the specified amount of time.
There are 1,000 milliseconds in one second.  Thus, to obtain a delay
of one second, you would write:
<pre class="brush: mpide; toolbar: false;">
  delay(1000);
</pre>

<p>

We can now combine these functions in the body of
the <code>loop()</code> function such that the LED blink at one-second
intervals (i.e., be on for a second, then off for a second):
<pre class="brush: mpide; toolbar: false;">
void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
</pre>
